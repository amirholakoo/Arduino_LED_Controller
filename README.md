# Arduino LED Controller with Button Interface

This project is a simple, yet cool Arduino LED Controller with a button interface. It has been developed by a passionate enthusiast, who is not a professional programmer, but managed to create this project with the help of an expert from OpenAI from A to Z. In this project, you'll learn how to control an LED's brightness and ON/OFF state using a push-button. This is perfect for beginners who want to get started with Arduino and explore its capabilities.

## Features

- Control an LED's ON/OFF state using a push-button
- Adjust the LED's brightness using the push-button
- Easy to set up and use, perfect for beginners
- Clear instructions and guidance for assembly and usage

## Required Components

- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- Breadboard
- LED
- Push-button
- 220-ohm resistor
- 10K-ohm resistor
- Jumper wires

## Pin Connections

- Connect the LED's anode (longer leg) to the digital pin 9 (PWM pin) on the Arduino board using a 220-ohm resistor.
- Connect the LED's cathode (shorter leg) to one of the GND pins on the Arduino board.
- Place the push-button on the breadboard.
- Connect one side of the push-button to the digital pin 2 on the Arduino board using a 10K-ohm resistor.
- Connect the other side of the push-button to the 5V pin on the Arduino board.
- Finally, connect a GND pin on the Arduino board to the breadboard's ground rail.

## Setup and Usage

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE on your computer: [Arduino IDE Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
4. Copy and paste the following code into the Arduino IDE:

```cpp
const int ledPin = 9;           // LED connected to digital pin 9
const int buttonPin = 2;        // Button connected to digital pin 2
int buttonState = 0;            // Variable to store button state
int ledState = 0;               // Variable to store LED state (0 = OFF, 1 = ON)
int brightness = 0;             // Variable to store LED brightness (0 - 255)

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // Set the LED pin as output
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);    // Set the button pin as input
}

void loop() {
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); // Read the button state
  
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {    // If the button is pressed
    delay(50);                  // Debounce delay
    while (digitalRead(buttonPin) == HIGH); // Wait for button release

    ledState = !ledState;       // Toggle the LED state

    if (ledState) {             // If the LED is ON
      for (brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
        analogWrite(ledPin, brightness); // Gradually increase brightness
        delay(10);
      }
    } else {                    // If the LED is OFF
      for (brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
        analogWrite(ledPin, brightness); // Gradually decrease brightness
        delay(10);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
6. Upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking on the Upload button.

Now, when you press the push button, the LED will gradually turn ON with increasing brightness. When you press the button again, the LED will gradually turn OFF with decreasing brightness.

## Troubleshooting

- If the LED does not respond to the button press, double-check the connections and make sure that you have uploaded the code to the Arduino board.
- If the LED stays on or off, ensure that the button is correctly connected and working. You can test the button using a multimeter.
- If the LED's brightness does not change smoothly, try adjusting the delay values in the `for` loops.
